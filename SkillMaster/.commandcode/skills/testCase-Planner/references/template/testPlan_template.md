Yes. If your goal is to create one Agent Skills package in the agentskills.io / SKILL.md format and reuse it across multiple coding agents, there is a much better structure than creating a separate copy for every tool.

I checked the current documentation for the major agents you listed. The important distinction is between Agent Skills (SKILL.md) and older agent-specific mechanisms such as CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules, Kiro steering, etc.

Recommended cross-agent location
For a project-level skill, I would use:

your-project/
└── .agents/
    └── skills/
        └── your-skill/
            ├── SKILL.md
            ├── scripts/
            ├── references/
            └── assets/
SKILL.md is the standardized skill entry point. OpenCode explicitly supports .agents/skills, and Kilo and Cursor also support the shared .agents/skills convention. (OpenCode)

The standardized format itself is essentially:

skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
with YAML frontmatter containing at least name and description. OpenCode, Kiro and Kilo explicitly document this structure. (OpenCode)

The important part for YOUR setup
You mentioned:

GitHub Copilot
Claude Code
Cursor
Windsurf
Kilo
Kiro
OpenCode
"command code" — I assume you mean Claude Code
and potentially other agents you're using
I would not maintain 7–8 copies of the same skill.

Instead, structure your repository like this:

my-project/
│
├── .agents/
│   └── skills/
│       ├── api-testing/
│       │   ├── SKILL.md
│       │   ├── references/
│       │   └── scripts/
│       │
│       ├── playwright-testing/
│       │   └── SKILL.md
│       │
│       └── test-case-generation/
│           └── SKILL.md
│
├── .github/
│   └── skills/             # Copilot-specific mirror/config if required
│
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/             # Claude-specific mirror if required
│
├── .cursor/
│   └── skills/             # Cursor-specific mirror if required
│
├── .kiro/
│   └── skills/             # Kiro-specific
│
└── .opencode/
    └── skills/             # OpenCode-specific, optional
But there is an even cleaner option.

⭐ My recommendation: use .agents/skills as your canonical source
my-project/
└── .agents/
    └── skills/
        └── playwright-testing/
            └── SKILL.md
Then your canonical skill is:

.agents/skills/playwright-testing/SKILL.md
Why?
OpenCode explicitly searches:

.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
both at project level and globally:

~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
It also supports .claude/skills and .opencode/skills. (OpenCode)

Kilo explicitly supports .agents/skills as a compatibility directory. (Kilo)

Cursor supports .agents/skills in addition to .cursor/skills. (Learn Cursor)

This is why .agents/skills is currently the most useful portable location.

If you want ONE global folder
If you want the skill available across projects rather than committed into every Git repository, use:

~/.agents/skills/
For example on macOS/Linux:

~/.agents/
└── skills/
    └── playwright-testing/
        └── SKILL.md
So:

~/.agents/skills/playwright-testing/SKILL.md
This is particularly attractive for OpenCode + Codex + other Agent Skills-compatible agents.

OpenCode officially supports:

~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
as a global location. (OpenCode)

Agent-specific paths
There are some important exceptions.

Claude Code
Claude Code's native location is:

.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
or globally:

~/.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
So if you want the most conservative Claude-only setup:

~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
The Agent Skills format is still the same SKILL.md.

Cursor
Native:

.cursor/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
Global:

~/.cursor/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
Cursor also supports .agents/skills, which makes it useful for portability. (Learn Cursor)

Kilo
Native:

.kilo/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
Global:

~/.kilo/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
But Kilo explicitly loads the compatibility directory:

.agents/skills/
So you don't need a Kilo-specific copy if you're using the shared structure. (Kilo)

Kiro
Kiro's native paths are:

.kiro/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
and:

~/.kiro/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
Kiro officially supports the Agent Skills standard, so your existing SKILL.md can be imported without rewriting the skill format. (Kiro)

OpenCode
OpenCode gives you several options:

.opencode/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
and globally:

~/.config/opencode/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
~/.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
~/.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
This is officially documented by OpenCode. (OpenCode)

GitHub Copilot is the main exception
For GitHub Copilot's Agent Skills, the documented repository location is:

.github/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
Copilot automatically decides whether a skill is relevant based on its description and injects SKILL.md into the agent context when selected. (GitHub Docs)

So if Copilot is important to you, you have two practical approaches:

Option A — portability first
.agents/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
and use agents that recognize the shared directory.

Option B — maximum compatibility
Keep the canonical skill in Git and expose/copy it into each agent's native location:

.agents/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
.github/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
.cursor/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
.kiro/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
.opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
I prefer Option A + agent-specific adapters only where necessary.

My recommended architecture for you
Since you're working across many AI coding agents, I'd standardize your repository like this:

.ai/
├── skills/
│   ├── playwright/
│   │   ├── SKILL.md
│   │   ├── references/
│   │   └── scripts/
│   │
│   ├── selenium/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   │
│   ├── api-testing/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   │
│   └── test-case-generation/
│       └── SKILL.md
│
.agents/
└── skills/
    ├── playwright/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    ├── selenium/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    ├── api-testing/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── test-case-generation/
        └── SKILL.md
But actually, don't use .ai/skills as the discovery location. Make .agents/skills the actual canonical discovery directory.

So the simplest version is:

project/
└── .agents/
    └── skills/
        ├── skill-1/
        │   └── SKILL.md
        ├── skill-2/
        │   └── SKILL.md
        └── skill-3/
            └── SKILL.md
Then:

OpenCode       → .agents/skills
Claude Code    → .agents/skills / .claude/skills
Cursor         → .agents/skills / .cursor/skills
Kilo           → .agents/skills / .kilo/skills
Codex          → .agents/skills
Kiro           → .kiro/skills
Copilot        → .github/skills
Bottom line: If your priority is OpenCode + Claude Code + Cursor + Kilo + Codex + other Agent Skills-compatible agents, put your canonical skills in:

.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
For a global installation:

~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
OpenCode officially recognizes both project and global .agents/skills locations. (OpenCode)

One caution: don't blindly install third-party SKILL.md files. Skills are executable behavioral instructions and can include scripts/references; recent research has identified supply-chain and prompt-injection risks in skill ecosystems. (arxiv.org)
